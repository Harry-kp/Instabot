# Instabot

A python class to automate basic instagram operations that can be performed on PC using selenium framework.
This bot is not 'get 10K follower in one day'.It is a simple that will run on your machine.The bots which are in the market usually 
give more functionalities but they will get banned sooner or later.This is a simple bot.

# Motivation
- After reading [this](https://medium.com/better-programming/lets-create-an-instagram-bot-to-show-you-the-power-of-selenium-349d7a6744f7) article ,I try to add some functionalities to the given code in the article.
- Insta Users (specially bots) first follow you and then unfollow you after you follow them back,
  this practice is not an ethical way to gain follower and this is often frustrating.
- This class contains a method **analysis** that can return a list of these traitors and unfollow them using another method.
